# Renewable Energy Utilization Optimizer

Maximizing renewable energy utilization for cost savings and environmental impact.

## üöÄ Overview

This project addresses the critical problem of **sub-optimal renewable energy utilization at Walmart stores**. Despite significant investments in renewable energy, challenges persist in maximizing its usage, resulting in missed cost savings and environmental benefits.

Our solution is an **ML-powered dashboard** that provides **actionable insights**, enabling Walmart to efficiently manage its diverse energy resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Architecture

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Robust Data Ingestion and Storage üìä

**Challenge:**  
Walmart‚Äôs large-scale operations generate vast amounts of energy data (consumption, solar generation, grid prices) that require efficient organization and access.

**Solution:**  
- **Scalable Data Lake:** Built on **AWS S3**, partitioned for efficient querying.
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Synthetic data ingested hourly using **AWS Lambda** triggered by **Amazon EventBridge**.
- **Purpose:** Provides a constantly updated dataset for analytics and forecasting.

**Tech Stack:**  
`AWS S3`, `AWS Lambda`, `Amazon EventBridge`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent Machine Learning for Forecasting & Optimization üß†

**Challenge:**  
Without predictive foresight, energy decisions are reactive and inefficient.

**Solution:**  
- **Forecasting Models:**  
  - Predict future **energy consumption** and **solar generation** using **time-series forecasting** powered by **XGBoost**.
  - Inputs include HVAC, refrigeration, lighting, battery usage, time of day/week, etc.
- **Optimization Algorithm:**  
  - Uses forecasted and real-time data to recommend optimal energy mixes (solar, battery, grid).  
  - Example Recommendation: _"Pre-cool the store using solar before peak demand."_

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `NumPy`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ High-Performance Backend API üì°

**Challenge:**  
Need a scalable and efficient method to expose ML-powered intelligence to the dashboard.

**Solution:**  
- **FastAPI** serves as the backend API:
  - Loads ML models for forecasts and optimization.
  - Provides endpoints for real-time metrics, forecasts, recommendations, and historical data querying.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on **Railway.com** using **Docker** containers for consistency.

**Tech Stack:**  
`FastAPI`, `Docker`, `boto3 (for AWS S3 interaction)`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Intuitive User Interface (Dashboard) üñ•Ô∏è

**Challenge:**  
Store managers need clear, actionable insights presented visually for informed decisions.

**Solution:**  
- **Frontend Dashboard:**
  - Built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.
  - Features real-time energy consumption breakdown, interactive forecasts, optimization recommendations, and historical data.
  - Fully responsive and interactive UI.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Next.js`, `TypeScript`, `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Recharts`
